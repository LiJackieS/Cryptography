# Cryptography
<h1>Eliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a python program that uses public-key cryptography to enable to parties to securely exchange private keys across an insecure channel. The program is based off of the Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellemn key exchange algorithm in which it is similar to a discrete logarithmic problem where it is easy to calculate the multiple of a point but difficult to find the multipler for a point.
